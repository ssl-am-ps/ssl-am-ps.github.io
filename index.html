  <h1>Seamless Language Expansion: Enhancing Multilingual Mastery in Self-Supervised model for Speech Re-synthesis Task</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  Self-supervised (SSL) models have shown great performance in various downstream tasks like speech recognition and synthesis. However, they are typically developed for a limited set of languages, and may encounter new languages when applied in real-world scenarios. Developing a SSL model from scratch for a new language is costly due to its huge parameters. Thus, it is vital to figure out how to efficiently adapt an existed SSL model to a new language without impairing its original abilities. We propose novel adaptation methods and preservation strategies to achieve this goal.  Applied to mHuBERT, we investigate their effectiveness on multi-lingual speech re-synthesis task. Experiments show that adaptation methods enable mHuBERT to be applied to a new language (Mandarin) with the relative value of WER on speech re-synthesis task reduced up to 61.72%. Also, our preservation strategies ensure that the performance on speech re-synthesis for both existed and new languages remains intact
